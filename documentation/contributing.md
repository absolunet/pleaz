## What we are looking for _(Spoiler alert: ANYTHING)_

We love to receive contributions from the community! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation or the tests, submitting bug reports and feature requests or simply writing code.

**Please, before investing a lot of time, check with us if it's something we're interested in, just so we don't have to reject something you worked hard on...**


## How to submit a contribution

1. Create your own branch of the code (`feature|bug/{your_name}-{summary}`)
2. Do the changes in your branch
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, review the following aspects:
	* Please **do not change anything** pertaining to the versioning *(We'll take care of that)*.
	* Please **do not update** any dependencies not pertaining to your changes *(We'll take care of that)*.
	* Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
	* Be sure you have adjusted the tests accordingly.
	* Be sure you have adjusted the documentation accordingly.
4. Cleanup your branch and open a pull-request toward the development branch.
